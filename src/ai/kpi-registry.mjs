/**
 * KPI Registry — canonical mapping from natural-language KPI requests
 * to the exact the database query that answers them.
 *
 * Replaces the 300-line prose schema in system-prompt.ts with structured,
 * type-checked, schema-verified entries. Every column reference here was
 * validated against live DB on 2026-05-01 (see scripts/validate-kpi-mapping.ts
 * and docs/research/db-validation-results.md).
 *
 * Stage 1 of the implementation plan in
 * ~/.claude/plans/cheerful-enchanting-pine.md
 *
 * Two cross-references the registry MUST keep in sync with:
 *   - ORDER_STATUS / STATUS_LABELS in src/types/orderStatus.ts (canonical
 *     order status enum)
 *   - STATUS_TO_TIME_FIELD / STATUS_KEY_TO_DISPLAY in
 *     src/types/dispatchMonitoring.ts (canonical ticket lifecycle ↔ column
 *     mapping)
 *
 * To validate the registry against live DB, run:
 *     npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/check-kpi-registry.ts
